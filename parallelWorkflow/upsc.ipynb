    "essay1 = \"\"\"Tourism in India: A Tapestry of Heritage and Progress\n",
    "India is often described not just as a country, but as a continent of experiences. From the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas to the tropical backwaters of Kerala, tourism in India is a multi-faceted industry that serves as a bridge between the nation’s glorious past and its ambitious future. As of 2026, the sector has evolved from traditional sightseeing into a sophisticated engine of economic growth, cultural diplomacy, and sustainable development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pillars of Indian Tourism\n",
    "The diversity of India’s landscape and culture allows for several distinct \"niches\" that cater to global and domestic travelers alike:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural and Heritage Tourism: This remains the backbone of the industry. Iconic monuments like the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, and the ancient temples of Hampi or Madurai continue to draw millions. Recently, the government has focused on developing \"Archaeological Experiential Sites\" at locations like Lothal and Sarnath, blending conservation with immersive storytelling.\n",
    "+1\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiritual and Pilgrimage Tourism: India is the spiritual heart of the world. Beyond the traditional circuits like the Char Dham or Varanasi, there is a renewed push for the Buddhist Circuit across the North-East, aiming to connect international pilgrims with the roots of Buddhist philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical and Wellness Tourism: Under the \"Heal in India\" initiative, the country has become a premier global healthcare destination. By offering world-class surgical procedures and traditional Ayurveda at a fraction of Western costs, India is attracting a new demographic of \"medical value travelers.\"\n",
    "+1\n",
    "\n",
    "Eco and Adventure Tourism: With a growing global focus on the environment, India has introduced thematic trails, such as Turtle Trails in Odisha and Mountain Trails in Jammu & Kashmir. These initiatives encourage responsible travel that supports local biodiversity.\n",
    "+1\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic Impact and Government Initiatives\n",
    "Tourism is a vital contributor to the Indian economy, accounting for approximately 6–7% of the national GDP. It is one of the largest employers in the country, supporting over 40 million jobs ranging from high-end hospitality to local artisans and guides.\n",
    "+1\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach the target of a $3 trillion tourism economy by 2047, the government has launched several strategic programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Union Budget 2026-27: Recent allocations focus on upskilling 10,000 tour guides in collaboration with IIMs and transforming the National Council for Hotel Management into a world-class National Institute of Hospitality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure Development: The Swadesh Darshan 2.0 and PRASHAD schemes are modernizing the infrastructure at 50 \"challenge-mode\" destinations, ensuring they meet international standards for cleanliness and connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Integration: The Unified Tourism Interface—linking UPI, DigiYatra, and ONDC—has revolutionized the traveler’s journey, making payments and movement across states seamless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges and the Road Ahead\n",
    "Despite its potential, the sector faces hurdles. Over-tourism in popular hill stations, infrastructure gaps in remote areas, and the need for stricter safety standards for women are ongoing concerns. Furthermore, while the \"Incredible India\" brand is iconic, there is a push in 2026 to overhaul it with \"country-specific strategies,\" recognizing that a traveler from Japan has different needs and interests than one from Germany.\n",
    "+1\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Tourism in India is no longer just about the \"Golden Triangle\" of Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. It is about the \"Glowmads\" seeking beauty rituals, the hikers exploring the Eastern Ghats, and the patients seeking healing. By balancing its ancient philosophy of \"Atithi Devo Bhava\" (The Guest is God) with modern technology and sustainable practices, India is well on its way to becoming a global tourism superpower.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "essay2 = \"\"\"India tourism is like a big biryani of many things because many people come here for see many things like Taj Mahal which is white and very big and also old. Actually tourism is good for money of India because many people give money for hotels and autos and that is why India is growing like a rocket in the sky of world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In India there is many weather like very hot and very cold and also rain. If you go to North there is mountain with ice but if you go to South there is water and coconut trees which is looking very green. Some people say India is very crowd but I say India is very heart because people are very helping and they say guest is like God which is a very old saying from long ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there is food which is very spicy and many foreigners like it but some get stomach problem but still they eat because taste is very yum. Many temples are there with many Gods and people ring bell and it feels very peace in the mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Government is also doing things like making roads and trains which is running fast like Vande Bharat which is a blue and white train and looks very modern. Tourism is very important because if no tourism then how we show our culture to the world people? So we must keep India clean and not throw plastic on the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall tourism is a very big essay topic because India is a very big country and everyone should come here at least one time in their life to see the beauty of India and eat the food and take many photos for mobile and Instagram.\"\"\""

      "feedback='The essay titled \"Tourism in India: A Tapestry of Heritage and Progress\" is well-organized and informative, showcasing the various facets of Indian tourism and the measures being taken for its advancement. The language used is generally clear and articulate, with a sophisticated vocabulary that enhances the overall quality of the writing. Here are some specific points of feedback:\\n\\n1. **Structure and Coherence**: The essay is structured logically, with clear headings for each subsection. This aids the reader in following the narrative about Indian tourism, its growth, its various niches, and the associated challenges. Each section flows smoothly into the next, contributing to the overall coherence.\\n\\n2. **Content Depth**: The essay provides a thorough overview of the diverse tourism sectors in India, including cultural, spiritual, medical, wellness, eco, and adventure tourism.

However, some sections could benefit from more specific examples or data to strengthen arguments.\\n\\n3. **Language and Style**: The tone is formal and appropriate for an academic or informative essay. The use of terminology specific to tourism and economic growth adds credibility. Additionally, the incorporation of idiomatic expressions like \"Atithi Devo Bhava\" links cultural significance to modern practices, effectively enhancing the narrative.\\n\\n4. **Areas for Improvement**: While the essay is largely well-written, there are a few areas that could be improved:\\n   - **Clarity**: In some instances, the sentences are densely packed with information, which might overwhelm the reader. Breaking up complex ideas into simpler sentences could improve clarity.\\n   - **Engagement**: Incorporating more engaging anecdotes or examples from tourists or specific experiences could help create a more vivid picture of India’s tourism.\\n   - **Proofreading**: Minor grammar and punctuation errors could lead to a slightly lower formal accuracy, which can be fixed with careful proofreading.\\n\\n5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion effectively summarizes the essay and reinforces the main themes discussed. It leaves the reader with a sense of optimism about the future of tourism in India.\\n\\nOverall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of language and a deep understanding of the subject matter, although it could benefit from a few refinements to enhance clarity and reader engagement.\\n\\n**Score: 8/10**' score=8\n"

However, the language quality is lacking in several areas. \\n\\nFirst, the grammar and sentence structure need improvement. Phrases like 'like a big biryani of many things' are too informal and metaphorical for an academic essay, while simple mistakes such as ‘there is many weather’ should be corrected to ‘there is much weather’ or ‘there are many types of weather’ to ensure grammatical accuracy.\\n\\nAdditionally, the use of phrases like 'India is growing like a rocket in the sky of world' is overly casual and could be better expressed in a more formal manner. Moreover, the essay tends to become repetitive, particularly with the frequent use of 'many.' Varying the vocabulary and employing synonyms can enhance the overall language quality. \\n\\nThe transition between ideas could be smoother, as the essay jumps from one topic to another somewhat abruptly.

Overall, more attention to language mechanics, coherence, and structure is needed to elevate the essay to a higher quality.\", 'analysis_feedback': \"The essay presents a personal view of tourism in India, comparing it to a biryani to highlight the diverse attractions and experiences the country offers. However, the analysis lacks depth and structure. Key strengths include the use of vivid imagery (e.g., Taj Mahal, mountains, coconut trees) and relatable expressions about local culture and hospitality. On the downside, grammatical errors (e.g., 'for see', 'there is many weather') detract from clarity and coherence. The ideas are somewhat jumbled, and transitions between thoughts are weak. Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more detailed examples and a stronger conclusion. A more organized presentation of points would enhance its overall impact and persuasiveness.\", 'clarity_feedback': 'The essay presents a general overview of tourism in India, but it lacks clarity and cohesiveness in its arguments. Here are some points that stand out:\\n\\n1. **Structure**: The essay does not have a clear structure with distinct introduction, body, and conclusion paragraphs. It tends to jump from one idea to another without proper transitions. A more organized approach would enhance clarity.\\n \\n2. **Clarity of Ideas**: The metaphor of India as a \\'big biryani\\' is creative, but it is not thoroughly explained, leaving readers confused. Specific examples like the Taj Mahal are introduced, but there\\'s no deeper exploration of their significance in tourism. \\n\\n3. **Grammar and Language**: The language is simplistic and at times grammatically incorrect, which affects comprehension. Phrases such as \"very heart\" and \"if no tourism then how we show our culture\" could be rephrased for better fluency.\\n  \\n4. **Depth of Content**: The descriptions of weather and cultural aspects are quite superficial. For example, more in-depth discussion about the impact of tourism on local economies or cultural exchange would add depth, rather than just listing attractions and general characteristics.\\n \\n5. **Spelling and Usage**: There are occasional spelling and usage issues (e.g., \"yum\" is informal; using \"delicious\" would be more appropriate in an essay). Additionally, casual phrases should be avoided in formal writing (like saying \"peace in the mind\").\\n\\nOverall, while the essay touches on important aspects of tourism in India, it requires significant improvement in organization, clarity, and language to effectively convey its message.', 'individual_score': [4, 4, 4], 'summary_feedback': '**Final Summary Feedback**\\n\\nThe essay on tourism in India offers a personal perspective enriched with illustrative examples that highlight the country\\'s beauty, cultural diversity, and economic significance.

Phrases such as \"like a big biryani of many things\" and \"India is growing like a rocket in the sky of world\" are overly casual and metaphorical for an academic context. Corrections such as \"there is many weather\" should be adjusted to \"there is much weather\" or \"there are many types of weather\" for grammatical accuracy. Varying vocabulary to avoid repetition, especially with the frequent use of \"many\", will also improve the language quality.\\n\\n**Structure and Clarity**: The essay lacks a structured format, consisting of clearly defined introduction, body, and conclusion sections. Transitions between ideas are abrupt, which disrupts the flow of thought. A clearer organizational approach with distinct paragraphs can enhance coherence and allow ideas to be conveyed more effectively. The metaphor comparing India to \"a big biryani\" is creative but should be unpacked for clarity. Additionally, destinations like the Taj Mahal should be explored in greater depth to fully illustrate their significance in tourism.\\n\\n**Depth of Analysis**: While vivid imagery adds richness to the essay, the analysis itself lacks depth. Superficial discussions about cultural aspects and weather do not sufficiently engage with important issues like the impact of tourism on local economies or cultural exchanges. More detailed examples and insights would bolster the overall argument and persuasive power of the essay.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: While the conclusion summarizes the main points presented, it falls short of providing a strong, resonant closing statement that encapsulates the essay\\'s central argument. Strengthening the conclusion can leave a lasting impression on the reader.\\n\\nIn summary, to elevate this essay to a higher quality, substantial improvements in language mechanics, organization, clarity, and depth of content are required. By addressing these areas, the essay can more effectively convey its message about the vibrant tourism landscape of India.', 'average_score': 4.0}\n"
